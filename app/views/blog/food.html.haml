              San Francisco
            %h5.text-muted This city contends with NYC for #1...
            %p
              I came out to San Francisco to meet some startup folks. Since I want
              to break into the tech scene in this town, I figured I should maybe 
              try networking. Good thing my brother lives here and works in tech, 
              hopefully his network can help with the struggle. However, before 
              I start shaking hands and pounding down doors of any hardware startups
              I can get an intro to, I need to get into the SF vibe. And the best way 
              to do that is to get the chow on.

              Anyone that knows me can tell you that one of my favorite kinds of 
              food is indian food. I love that curry. And they also know that I'll
              annoyingly tell you that what you probably think is "curry" is not 
              actually curry. Most non-indians think that curry is a particular spice.
              It is not. It is a term synonomous with gravy. A dish that has some 
              kind of main protein, whether it be meat or vegetables, but sits in a 
              saucy like bath of flavors; this is curry. A curry dish can take on 
              a whole host of flavors, not necessarily the same flavor or scent that many
              Americans have in mind when they hear the word "curry".

              The photo above depicts one of the best curries I've had to date. 
              It's a real popular dish amongst American consumers of Indian food,
              Chicken Tikka Masala. And please don't call it "marsala", this is 
              not Italian food. Although I'm a fan of a good chicken Marsala, and this
              dish is equally popular in it's respective cultural domain, it is quite 
              different and bears no resemblance in look or taste of it's Italian 
              faux counter-part. Although, by the same designation, chicken Marsala 
              be considered a curry, since it's a saucy like dish.

              The dish here is a blend of tomatoes, cream, and coal-fired, marinated, 
              boneless chicken. The flavor is incredibly complex and each spice 
              shows up in every bite. The notes of cuman, coriander, fenugreek, 
              cardamom, and black pepper blend so perfectly together to create a 
              harmony of such a wide range of flavors. The tomato base gives the 
              the flavor range a solid depth, while the cream adds to 
              smoothness and front end flavors of the dish. If you're interested
              in checking it out, it's a small hole in the wall Pakistani place

              S'mores Bread Pudding...What!
            %h5.text-muted Wow..
            %p
              The best s'mores dish I've ever had. Period.
              It wasn’t overwhelmingly marshmallowy. Nor was it too soft. Consistency, flavors, warmth, it was all perfect. I really can’t describe it that well, you just need to try it.

                Georgio’s of Gramercy was loaded with several other phenomenal dishes. After eating several appetizers, 3 entrees between two of us, drinks, and two desserts, the bill still somehow came out to less than $100. Wow.

              I’m pretty particular about burgers. Especially since I lived in San Diego for so many years, and despite my love for that place, I will say with conviction that a real burger is almost non-existant there. In a society where In-n-Out burger is respected as the best burger around, the old-school style burger boasting an inch thickness or more, with a juicy, pink center is something people don’t even know about! It might be obvious that I’m more than jaded from many failed search expeditions for a good burger whilst living in So-Cal.

                Back on the East Coast, a burger as described above is just about the minimum requirement.  A small, local diner chain called Jackson-Hole has a location situated in Englewood, New Jersey, which is where I found myself on this memorable day. Despite the recommendation I was given, I was quite skeptical of this supposed burger supremeness.

                  I ordered the burger standard as I do for the litmus test, like pizza, just cheese. Last second I decided to throw in the bacon, asked it to be cooked medium rare. I ended up the heavenly work-of-art you see above. The bacon was high-quality, likely maple-cured, perfectly cooked, and full of flavor. As you can see they didn’t skimp on it either. The beef was certainly from a premium cut as it was dense with that juicy, beefy flavor one dreams of when they’re craving a burger. The beef was the perfect ratio of fat to lean, I’m guessing 80/20. As you can see, it was also huge. Must have been well over ½ pound. Definitely a top recommendation if you’re craving a burger.
