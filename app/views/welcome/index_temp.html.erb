            I'm passionate about understanding how things work and crave the ability to build them myself. My time spent in manufacturing and product development has taught me a great deal in the way of what it takes to build a consumer product from the ground up.
          %p
            I'm fascinated with hardware and am currently working to further develop my product development know-how by learning more about electronics and teaching myself PCB design. I'm absolutely enamored with the current state of software. We live in an exciting time where software is revolutionizing the world. Read more about that in

            Hence why I'm developing my software skills as well. (i.e. this website was built by yours truly alone from the ground up.)

            While engineering was my professional identity and passion for years, I’m also an entrepreneur at heart. This naturally led me in the direction of product management in the workplace. Next to being CEO of a company, I believe product management is really the sweet spot in a product centered organization. Having the authority to target new market segments through your own research and analysis is a lot of freedom in exchange for limited responsibility.
          %p
            As more of a people person, I excelled in this role as I prefer to interact with customers rather than spend all of my time developing. And as a Product Manager, one must interact with all departments that the product touches and all customer types the product exchanges hands on. This means lots of interaction and good times.

            Gosh, I love food! I like all kinds of food. Only requirement is that it’s good food. However, an important note to point out is that good food need not be expensive food. Some of the best food experiences I’ve had were at cheap, ‘hole-in-the-wall’ places.
          %p
            Food is certainly one of my passions. Not only because I enjoy the taste, but I’m often fascinated by the culture that comes along with each different cuisine. Being open to trying all walks of food really offers you more enjoyment and variety in life. I write about these foods from time to time. Check out the link below to read my food blog.

Southern California was an amazing place to move to, especially coming from Upstate New York.

                  B.S., Mechanical Engineering & B.A. Mathematics (dual degree): I really enjoyed my time at SU. Most people that went to SU might say the same, although a good portion of them would say so because of the epic parties they spent their undergraduate career roving to and fro. Unlike those fun people, I spent the majority of undergraduate career in the library. This is partially due to the fact that I decided to pursue a second major in Math at the beginning of my 2nd year, in addition to a minor in business management. Despite the resulting schedule, I still made time to develop some great life-long friendships and good times I’ll never forget.

            %p.lead Have always been fascinated by way photographers can capture a completely unique perspective of a landscape, object, or person beyond what the average person can see with their own eyes. I aspire to eventually develop real photography skills. Check out a few of my best photos.

              %p.lead Strange thing is that I was a picky eater as a kid. Now I like just about everything. When I come across something real nice I take photos and write about why it was so fantastical. Check my food blog if you want to know of a few good spots.
